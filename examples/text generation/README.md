# Text Generation.

Producing text using Project Gutenburg (Alice in Wonderland).

## How?

In order to train the model, you need to run `python main.py` from the terminal.
This will train the entire model for 20 epochs and generate the model weight, structure and 
other relevant files.

## Producing text.

Once the model has been trained and saved, it can be easily imported into Flux. Run 
`julia main.jl` from the terminal to run the model and produce 
artificial text.

```
$ julia main.jl

Original text: went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not a mome

Produced text: went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not a mome tf the toiet

```

Note: By default, the Keras model is trained upto 15 epochs. To get better results, it is
advicable to train the model for atleast 25 epochs. (Just change the epochs in Line 62 in `main.py`)
